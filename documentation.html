        <h1>Project Documentation</h1>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>In the initial stages of this project, I brainstormed several potential ways to visualize the relationship between college tuition and graduation rates. I experimented with different chart types, including bar charts, scatterplots, and line graphs. Eventually, I decided to use a scatterplot for its ability to display both variables clearly and show the correlation between them.</p>


        <h2>Rationale of Design Choices</h2>
        <p>The scatterplot was chosen as the primary visualization because it effectively shows the relationship between two continuous variables: tuition and graduation rate. By plotting tuition on the x-axis and graduation rate on the y-axis, I could easily observe any trends or patterns. 
        I chose to add in filters to differentiate between public and private colleges on the visualization. This choice helps to differentiate the two types of institutions and observe any potential trends in graduation rates or tuition costs based on the institution type.
        Additionally, I included interactive tooltips that display the college's name, tuition cost, and graduation rate when hovering over a data point. This allows users to explore specific data points in more detail.</p>

        <h2>Discoveries and Insights</h2>
        <p>Using the scatterplot, I was able to confirm that there is a general trend where higher tuition is associated with higher graduation rates, particularly among private colleges. However, some colleges with higher tuition have lower graduation rates, suggesting other factors contribute to graduation success. Here is a screenshot of the visualization, where you can see the trend:</p>

        <h2>Video Demonstration</h2>
        <p>I have created a short video showing the how the visualization works and how you can navigate between the visualization page and the documentation page. You can check the video out below:</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, this project provided valuable insights into the relationship between tuition costs and graduation rates across U.S. colleges. The interactive visualization allowed me to explore the dataset in a meaningful way, leading to insights that could guide further analysis and decision-making regarding higher education.</p>
